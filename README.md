## Acknowledgment

This project was originally created by [Ahmet KatrancÄ±](https://github.com/katranci), called [github-npm-stats](https://github.com/katranci/github-npm-stats) (check it out!). I loved the idea and wanted to contribute to it, but it appears that the project is no longer maintained, and it was due for a rewrite with modern build tools and TypeScript. The original project was licensed under the [MIT](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) license - as is this project.
